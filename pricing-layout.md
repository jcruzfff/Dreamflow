Toggle Navigation

Four categories:
Website & App, Branding, Marketing & Content, Development

Each toggle reveals a unique configurator form.

Users configure design requests via toggles, style pickers, and text inputs.

Each category has its own scoped inputs (e.g., Website type, Brand style, etc.)

Live Cart Summary (Right Panel)

Allows edits/removals

Displays estimated cost and a “Save with Plan” upsell CTA

Checkout button at the bottom

One-Screen Experience

All inputs happen on a single screen with minimal friction

Tailored UX per category (Website, Branding, etc.)

Optional inputs (e.g., upload references or describe goals)

🧩 Purpose & Value
